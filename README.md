<h4>Technologies</h4>

This application was created using React, React-Redux, and Firebase, along with APIs from Weather Underground and Google Maps.

<h4>Current Functionality</h4>

Have you ever need to see weather in multiple locations at once? Weather Routes is a useful application that displays the weather for up to four locations at once.

Entering locations is easy and can be done in two ways
<ol>
<li>Enter zipcode or city and state on the main page</li>
<li>Pick up to four locations on google maps</li>
</ol>

For logged in users, the locations can be saved and referenced for future uses.  This could be useful to see the weather at places frequented, such as bike routes, or multiple beach towns on the same screen

Weather-Routes will be deployed in the near future, after issues with too many hits per minute using the key are resolved.
